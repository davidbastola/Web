                    Website architecture envelops various aptitudes and teaches in the generation and support of sites. The distinctive regions of website architecture incorporate web visual computerization; interface configuration; composing, including institutionalized code and restrictive programming; client encounter plan; and site improvement. Web development is the act of developing or building any webpage. As studying this module content building webpage is now easier for us. The report depends on the portfolio which characterizes about the individual data. As characterizing about the battles I made amid the formation of the portfolio I needed to visit a few locales as references .As going to those destinations I found numerous destinations utilizing JAVA likewise, as we have criteria of just utilizing HTML5 and CSS3 I needed to explore more. It was some place useful for us too. It required greater investment to look into as it increased more learning about codes and the methods for usage of them to finish a straightforward and successful HTML5 and CSS3 based site.
                Here are some of the main definitions listed below:

                   </h3>
                   <h2>HTML (Hypertext Markup Language):</h2>
                   <h3>HTML is one of the widely used language in website development. It is the key for displaying the information in the browsers window. It is just a markup language that tells the browsers how to format the structure where to locate the element with the help of HTML tags. These tags like < header >, < p >, < Title > and others define the structure of the webpages. Also it helps in marking up the pages that is linking number of pages which is one of its salient features. HTML has number versions and here the latest version HTML5 is used in developing the website. It has many new features that makes us easy to write in HTML. (CSS, 2012) HTML components are the building squares of HTML pages. With HTML develops , pictures and different questions, for example, intelligent structures might be installed into the rendered page.
                   </h3>
                   <h2>
                    CSS (Cascading Style Sheet):
                   </h2>
                   <h3>
                    After designing the contents of the webpages we need to style it. HTML file are just the text documents that enables the browsers to display it in the windows. CSS is key to style the text, sections, heading, footers, images and others as per the requirement of the clients. Here, it allows developer to decorate webpages to make it more attractive and easy accessible. There are sets of rule in CSS that makes it a little bit different from HTML and XHTML. CSS3 is the upgraded version of CSS that allows user to make more graphic designing like text-designing, animation, background-image, borders, image values and many more. This makes us easy in designing website as we like it. (Duckett, 2011). CSS is planned basically to empower the division of introduction and substance, including viewpoints, for example, the design, hues, and fonts. This partition can enhance content openness, give greater adaptability and control in the determination of introduction qualities, empower various HTML pages to share arranging by indicating the important CSS in a different .css document, and decrease multifaceted nature and redundancy in the basic substance.
                   </h3>
                <h2>Webpages:</h2>
                <h3>A site page (additionally composed as site page) is an archive that is appropriate for the World Wide Web and web programs. A web program shows a site page on a screen or cell phone. Webpages It is basically a HTML document that has been designed by using CSS stylesheet. Here, my website consists of 6 webpages including home page too. All these webpages were linked to each other by hyperlink that is basically a feature of HTML that links documents by creating a virtual link between them which makes access easy. (Kleinberg, 2010)
                These documents are written in HTML (hypertext markup language) and are translated by your Web browser. Web pages can either be static or dynamic. Static pages show the same content each time they are viewed. Dynamic pages have content that can change each time they are accessed. 
                </h3>
                <h1>Designs</h1>

They would now have the ability to locate my own specific detail that they require with only a few ventures by investigating them on the web. These goals have made it more gainful and successful. For this I have utilized HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) that is a standard markup vernacular for making site pages.

I’ve utilized CSS3 to illuminate and style the site online pages, I’ve utilized CSS3.
                In this part I have attempted to demonstrate the pages that I have made and some screen captures, and have the simple layout of the straightforward design. I have made a few plans and wireframes utilizing some Drawing devices.
